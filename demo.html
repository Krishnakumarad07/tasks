                This article is about food for all organisms. For food for humans, see
                Human food. For other uses, see Food (disambiguation). "Foodstuffs"

                Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support.
                Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains
                essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins,
                or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated
                by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate
                growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours
                that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a
                specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

                Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtaining
                food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to
                prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required
                is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food
                through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food
                processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional
                agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food
                and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate
                change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas
                emissions
